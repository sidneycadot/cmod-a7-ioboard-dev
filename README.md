CMOD-A7 I/O board development
=============================

This repository contains files related to the development of an I/O board for the CMOD-A7 FPGA development board.

The CMOD-A7 is a low-cost FPGA development board built around a Xilinx Artix-series FPGA. Two versions are available
for purchase, that are populated with two different versions of the Artix A7 FPGA:

* cheaper version: XC7A15T-1CPG236C
* slightly more expensive version: XC7A35T-1CPG236C
